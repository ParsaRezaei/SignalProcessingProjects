                     LRPT IMAGE PROCESSOR

INSTALLATION

Extract all the files in the Zip archive to a directory /outside/ the
C:\Program Files\ tree.  I suggest C:\Tools\SatSignal\LRPTprocessor\
The program has been developed under Windows 10/64 but I would expect
it to run on Windows-XP and later.  Windows-7 and earlier are not
supported.  The program requires my Runtime Library Bundle to be installed,
if you don't already have it (not required should you already have the
MSG Data Manager installed).

STATUS

The program is unsupported software so please contact
the GEO-Subscribers or SatSignal group for help.


USAGE

The program can remove the edge compression present in the raw scan data
from the Meteor-M N2 LRPT data, create a vegetation image, thermal image,
and a false-colour image.  The thermal components rely on you saving a
1-2-5 image from the decoder program.  In the LRPT offline decoder:

  Red => channel 1, 0.5 - 0.7 µm
  Green => channel 2, 0.7 - 1.1 µm
  Blue => channel 5, 10.5 - 11.5 µm

You can feed the program with a image (BMP or JPG) named on the command-line,
or use drag-and-drop from File Explorer onto the open program, or use the
File|Open menu.  Output images are automatically saved as JPG or BMP in the
same directory as the input image.

Use drag-and-drop to load.  You will need the 10 µm thermal channel
(PID: 68) for the options which depend on thermal.

The program has been developed in Embarcadero's Delphi using Windows-10,
and I would hope that the program would work on Windows XP SP3 and later.
It will also work in Linux/WINE!  Only Windows-10 is supported, though.

Feedback to the GEO-Subscribers group, please.
