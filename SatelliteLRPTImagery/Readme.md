# Satellite LRPT Imagery Signal Processing Project - Jan-May 2022

This project involved receiving digital LRPT imagery from orbiting satellites using a software-defined radio and a homemade antenna. The following tasks were completed during this project:

 - Created a scheduled program that helped plan and execute data capture missions for orbiting satellites.
 - Utilised a Low Noise Amplifier to filter out unwanted signals.
