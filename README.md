# SignalProcessingProjects
This repository contains two projects completed between January and May 2022.

## Radio Garage Door Opener Signal Processing Project

The Radio Garage Door Opener Signal Processing Project involved designing and implementing a smart garage door opener using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) and a Raspberry Pi (RPi). The following tasks were completed:

- Captured and decoded the remote transmitter code using GNU radio
- Used the RPiâ€™s Tx pin to transmit the captured data and open the garage door

## Satellite LRPT Imagery Signal Processing Project

The Satellite LRPT Imagery Signal Processing Project involved using a software defined radio and a homemade antenna to receive Digital LRPT imagery from orbiting satellites. The following tasks were completed:

- Created a scheduled program that helped plan and execute data capture missions for orbiting satellites
- Utilized a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) to filter out unwanted signals
