This project involved designing and implementing a smart garage door opener using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) and a Raspberry Pi. The following tasks were completed during this project:

- Captured and decoded the remote transmitter code using GNU radio
- Used the RPi’s Tx pin to transmit the captured data to open the garage door
